Mission:

The key principles of a Modular Architecture are:

Separation of Concerns: Divide your application into smaller, focused modules that each handle a specific set of functionalities or responsibilities.
Loose Coupling: Minimize the dependencies between modules, so they can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
Cohesion: Ensure that the modules are highly cohesive, meaning that the code within a module is tightly related and serves a single, well-defined purpose.
Pluggability: Design your modules to be easily interchangeable and replaceable, allowing you to swap out implementations without affecting the rest of the application.
Extensibility: Structure your framework in a way that makes it easy to add new modules or extend existing ones as your requirements evolve.
Some key benefits of a Modular Architecture for your Node.js tooling and CLI programs:

Maintainability: By separating concerns and minimizing dependencies, you can more easily understand, debug, and update individual components of your application.
Scalability: Adding new features or functionality becomes simpler, as you can plug in new modules without affecting the rest of the system.
Testability: Each module can be tested in isolation, making it easier to ensure the correct behavior of individual components.
Flexibility: The pluggable nature of the modules allows you to swap out implementations or try different approaches without a major overhaul of your codebase.
To implement a Modular Architecture, you could consider the following structure:

Core Module: This module would contain the essential functionality and logic that's shared across all your tools and CLI programs.
Utility Modules: These modules would provide common utility functions, data transformations, and other reusable functionality.
CLI Modules: Each of your CLI programs would be its own module, encapsulating the specific command-line interface and associated logic.
Adapter Modules: These modules would handle integration with external services, APIs, or libraries, providing a consistent interface for your core and CLI modules.
By following this Modular Architecture approach, you can create a flexible, maintainable, and scalable framework for your Node.js tooling and CLI programs, which will help reduce the need for painful decision-making in the future.

src/core: This directory contains the core functionality and shared utility modules that are used across all your CLI programs.
src/adapters: This directory holds modules that handle integration with external services, APIs, or libraries.
src/cli: This directory contains the individual CLI program modules. Each CLI program has its own subdirectory with an index.js file and a commands directory for the various commands.
src/common: This directory stores shared configuration, constants, and other common utility files.
tests: This directory contains the unit tests for your framework, organized by the same structure as the src directory.
bin: This directory holds the entry point scripts for each of your CLI programs.

    src/core: This directory contains the core functionality and shared utility modules that are used across the entire application.
index.js: This file exports the core functionality and utilities.
utils/logger.js: This module provides logging functionality for the application.
utils/validation.js: This module handles input validation for the application.
src/adapters: This directory holds modules that handle integration with external services or libraries.
puppeteer.js: This module encapsulates the Puppeteer-related functionality, such as launching the browser, navigating to the LLM AI app, and interacting with the page.
fileStorage.js: This module handles the storage of the scraped responses in a JSON file.
src/services: This directory contains the business logic of the application.
promptGenerator.js: This module generates the prompts to be used with the LLM AI app.
responseScraperService.js: This module handles the scraping of the responses from the LLM AI app.
src/repositories: This directory holds modules responsible for data access and management.
responseRepository.js: This module handles the storage and retrieval of the scraped responses from the JSON file.
src/config: This directory stores configuration-related files.
index.js: This file exports the application configuration, including the prompt definitions.
prompts.json: This file contains the prompts to be used with the LLM AI app.

Architectural Layers:

Core Layer: The src/core directory contains the core functionality and utility modules that are used throughout the application, such as the logger and validation utilities. This layer provides a foundation for the rest of the application.
Adapter Layer: The src/adapters directory holds the modules responsible for interacting with external services or libraries, such as Puppeteer and the file storage. This layer abstracts away the implementation details, providing a consistent interface for the upper layers.
Service Layer: The src/services directory contains the business logic of the application, such as the prompt generation and response scraping. This layer orchestrates the use of the adapter and repository layers to perform the core functionality of the application.
Repository Layer: The src/repositories directory holds the modules responsible for data access and management, in this case, the storage and retrieval of the scraped responses in a JSON file-based database. This layer encapsulates the data-related operations, providing a consistent interface for the upper layers.
Configuration Layer: The src/config directory stores the application-level configuration, including the prompt definitions. This layer ensures that the configuration is centralized and easily modifiable.
By separating the application into these distinct layers, you can achieve a high degree of modularity, maintainability, and testability. The core layer provides a foundation, the adapter layer handles external integration, the service layer encapsulates the business logic, the repository layer manages the data, and the configuration layer stores the application settings. This modular architecture allows you to easily swap out implementations, test individual components in isolation, and make changes to the application without affecting the entire codebase.


Example of validate.js:

import path from 'path';

export function validateConfig(config) {
  if (typeof config !== 'object' || config === null) {
    console.error('Invalid configuration: Configuration must be an object.');
    return false;
  }

  if (typeof config.appUrl !== 'string' || config.appUrl.trim() === '') {
    console.error('Invalid configuration: appUrl must be a non-empty string.');
    return false;
  }

  if (typeof config.logFilePath !== 'string' || config.logFilePath.trim() === '') {
    console.error('Invalid configuration: logFilePath must be a non-empty string.');
    return false;
  }

  if (!Array.isArray(config.prompts) || config.prompts.length === 0) {
    console.error('Invalid configuration: prompts must be a non-empty array.');
    return false;
  }

  for (const prompt of config.prompts) {
    if (typeof prompt !== 'string' || prompt.trim() === '') {
      console.error('Invalid configuration: Each prompt must be a non-empty string.');
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

export function validateFilePath(filePath) {
  if (typeof filePath !== 'string' || filePath.trim() === '') {
    console.error('Invalid file path: File path must be a non-empty string.');
    return false;
  }

  if (!path.isAbsolute(filePath)) {
    console.error('Invalid file path: File path must be an absolute path.');
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
